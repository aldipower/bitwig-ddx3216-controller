### Highlights

* Exact dB fader mapping! -10dB in Bitwig is -10dB on the DDX3216 and so on.

### ToDo - Things I would like to have

* Scroll a selected track into the arranger view - In Bitwig there is the TrackBank and the CursorBank. I could not figure out how the interact yet to create proper automatic scrolling to a selected track.

### Not so nice, but also not deadly.

* Real select buttons not working.
* No solo buttons: The DDX3216 has no Sysex or CC implementation for the solo buttons, so they simply do not work.
* No pan at bus, aux and FX faders: Faders 33-64 are not panable, due to the lack of Sysex or CC commands. Did they ran out of memory or what?
